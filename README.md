# River Raid Game

**River Raid** is a 2D arcade-style shooting game built using Pygame, where the player controls a plane, avoids obstacles, and collects fuel to stay alive. The objective is to survive as long as possible while earning points by destroying obstacles and avoiding collisions.

## Features

- **Plane Movement**: The plane is controlled by moving the mouse horizontally. The plane follows the mouse along the X-axis.
- **Shooting**: Left-click to shoot bullets at obstacles. Obstacles take multiple hits to be destroyed.
- **Obstacles**: Various obstacles spawn randomly. Colliding with an obstacle results in a game over.
- **Fuel**: Fuel items spawn randomly. Collecting fuel will restore a part of the fuel bar.
- **Score**: Earn points by destroying obstacles. The score is displayed on the top-right corner.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the plane collides with an obstacle or if the fuel runs out.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

To install Pygame, use the following command:

```bash
